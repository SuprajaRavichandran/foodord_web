       <p>Excess calories from fast-food meals can cause weight gain. This may lead toward obesity. <br>
        Obesity increases your risk for  respiratory problems, including asthma and shortness of breath.<br>
        The extra pounds can put pressure on your heart and lungs and symptoms may show up even with little exertion.<br>
        Eating a poor quality diet high in junk food is linked to a higher risk of obesity, depression, digestive <br>
        issues, heart disease and stroke, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and early death. And as you might expect,<br>
         frequency matters when it comes to the impact of junk food on your health.<br>
         <br><b>Remedy</b>
         Opt for salads and grilled foods instead of fried and breaded items to minimize the impact of 
         fast food on your health. If you choose salad, be wary of putting a lot of dressing or cheese on it,
          as these can add a lot of hidden calories and sugar to your otherwise healthy meal.
          A simple home Remedy to avoid toxics from eating fast food is doing exersice or yoga, walking,
          <br>jogging, drinking warm water after the food helps you to reduce the disadvantage.
