        aid digestion and help you lose weight.The lycopene in tomato juice may help lower the risk of 
        prostate cancer. Beet juice may help curb blood pressure. Pulpy vegetable juice has some fiber 
        and fiber cuts hunger. You also get far less sugar and fewer calories than in the typical
