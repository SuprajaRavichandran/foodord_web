        Does Sugar Free have less calories?
        Sugar substitutes taste sweet but don't contain sugar. They have fewer calories than sugar,
        and some have no calories at all. Foods labeled “sugar-free,” “keto,” “low carb” or “diet”
        often contain sugar substitutes, which fall into three categories: artificial sweeteners, 
        sugar alcohols and novel sweeteners.</p>
