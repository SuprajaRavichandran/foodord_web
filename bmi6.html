        Certain lifestyle changes can help you manage obesity, improve your overall health and/or lose weight, including:<br><br>

       <b> Heart-healthy eating:</b> Your healthcare provider may recommend meeting with a registered dietician or nutritionist to learn about which foods and amounts of food are part of a healthy eating pattern. If you need to lose weight, it's important to try to reduce your total daily calories gradually. Talk with your provider before making any drastic changes to your diet.<br><br>
        <b>Physical activity:</b> Physical activity has many health benefits, and it's an important factor in determining whether a person can maintain a healthy body weight, lose excess body weight or maintain healthy weight loss. Before starting any exercise program, ask your healthcare provider about what amount and type of physical activity is right for you.<br><br>
        <b>Healthy sleep:</b> If you're not getting enough sleep or have a sleep disorder, it's essential to return to healthy sleep and/or receive treatment for sleep disorders in order to manage obesity. Lack of sleep is linked to weight gain.<br><br>
        <b>Stress management:</b> Chronic stress can contribute to weight gain, so it's important to learn to cope with stress in a healthy way, such as with meditation or breathing exercises, and minimize it as much as possible.<br><br>
