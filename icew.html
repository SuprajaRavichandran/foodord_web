       <p>Ice cream has several downsides. It's low in nutrients, high in added sugar and calories, 
        and may contain artificial ingredients. Occasional treats like ice cream are okay when you 
        eat an otherwise healthy diet, but they should never be the foundation of your daily sustenance.

         <br><b>REMEDY:</b><br><br>
         Drinking warm water after ice cream reduces the intensity of cold getting enhanced.
The reason is simple, the sugar crystals [food for germs], gets washed off from the teeth 
and cavities and it soothes the throat.
