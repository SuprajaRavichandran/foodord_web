       <p>A 12-ounce can of soda has between about 125 and 180 calories. All of those come from sugar
        between 8 and 11 teaspoons in your glass. Those numbers give this drink a reputation as
        a nutritional bad guy. Still, there are lots of other beverages that have as many or more 
        calories as a soda.
        Drinking high-sugar soft drinks is most commonly associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes,
         and weight gain. But sodas can also have ill effects on your smile, potentially leading 
        to cavities and even visible tooth decay. â€¦ When you drink soda, the sugars it contains 
        interact with bacteria in your mouth to form acid.
        <br>
         <br><b>REMEDY:</b><br><br>
         You should also rinse your mouth with water after drinking soda as it can help to wash 
away acids and sugars to keep them from attacking your teeth. You should avoid drinking soda
before bedtime as the sugar and acid will have an opportunity to attack your teeth all night.
